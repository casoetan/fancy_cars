# My Assumptions

- The application is not ready for production and still needs QA
  - Dev environment
  - No need to build
- No tests
- No readme or documentation
- No errors / errors are not handled
- API is 100% available
- Limit libraries except very crucial ones (like Redux & Redux Saga)
- Not testing UI/UX skills
- Use plain Javascript (No Typescript, Flow)
